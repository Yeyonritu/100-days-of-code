<h1>The Best Series According to my Dearie</h1>
<h2>Her Top 3 Series Recommendation</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>You (Netflix)</h3>
<p>This is my personal favourite. Love is my best character.</p>
<h3>Dexter (Paramount+)</h3>
<p>This would have been number 1 but kinda went on too long. RIP Debra</p>
<h3>OwlHouse (Disney plus)</h3>
<p>It has a lot of very expressive characters. This is the most unique of the bunch.</p>
